# FAQ

## What is VPOS?

When you stake your $VISION, you auto-magically receive $VPOS that will be used as proof-of-stake.

With the $VPOS received you are able to stake for rewards in the VISION Pool.

## What happens if I sell my VPOS?

Please do not sell/exchange your $VPOS.

If you sell your $VPOS you won't be able to unstake your $VISION as you need the same amount of $VPOS to do so.

## How can I stake VISION?

You can stake your VISION on the "Pools" page by clicking on the little "+" sign after approving the contract, choose the amount you want to stake and confirm.

Staking page: [https://visiondefi.io/pools](https://visiondefi.io/pools)

## What is the difference between staking and farming?

STAKING: You only need to stake the token instead of a LP token in order to stake in the pools.

FARMING: In order to farm you need to provide liquidity to one of the pools on the farming page and then stake your LP tokens.

Both have their own advantages and disadvantages. Which one to choose is up to your strategy.

## How do I farm?

In order to farm you first have to provide liquidity to one of the pools which you can find on the "Farm" page.

After providing liquidity and receiving your LP tokens then select the pool you joined from the "Farm" page, approve the contract and then click on the little "+" sign, choose the amount you want to stake and confirm.

## How do I connect my wallet to VisionDefi?

In order to connect your wallet you have to click on the "Unlock Wallet" button on the top-right corner of the page. After that, look for the wallet you want to connect to VisionDefi and click "connect". Approve the connection and you're good to go.

## How do I set up my wallet on Binance Smart Chain?

Trust Wallet: When you go into the dAPP in the top-right corner you can see the different blockchains available, click on it then choose Binance Smart Chain Mainnet.

MetaMask: Create a custom RPC with the following:

* Network Name: BSC Mainnet
* RPC URL: [https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/](https://bsc-dataseed.binance.org/)
* ChainID: 56
* Symbol: BNB
* Block Explorer URL: [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)

## Why is my transaction failing?

Check the TX on [https://bscscan.com/](https://bscscan.com/)

If it says "burn amount exceeds balance" you forgot to unstake your $VPOS. \(This if the transaction fails while trying to unstake $VISION\)

If there is any other message it might be a problem within BSC, please try increasing the transfer fees to 20 GWEI 200,000 Gas limit.

## When will you open more pools?

There will always be an announcement before the launch of new pools.

Join the announcements Telegram group to be the first that finds out.

## How do I get airdrops?

When there is any official airdrop going on it will be announced along with the requirements.

Please remember anyone can airdrop tokens to VisionDefi users since every transaction is public on BSCScan. Do your own due diligence when it comes to non-official airdrops.

## Why does it say I have no BNB balance?

You're most likely not connected to Binance Smart Chain within your wallet.

## What is the max supply of CAKE?

210,000,000 VISION.
